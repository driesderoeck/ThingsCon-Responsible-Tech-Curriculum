ThingsCon Responsible Tech Curriculum

We're starting a curriculum around responsible, ethical tech: What's to consider when designing, developing, deploying or researching connected, data-driven systems using Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and the like?

This is an initiative by the ThingsCon (https://thingscon.com) community.
